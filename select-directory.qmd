-   Click the button labelled **"Set Cache Directory"** or any other action that opens the directory selector.
-   A window will appear, allowing you to browse your computerâ€™s file system.

```{r}

knitr::include_graphics("images/set-cache.jpg", dpi = 270)
```

### Select a Drive (if needed)

-   Use the **top-right drop-down menu** labelled with the current drive (e.g., `C:`) to select a different drive.
-   Click the drop-down arrow and choose the drive where the desired folder is located.

### Navigate Through the File System

-   Use the **left-hand panel** to browse available folders.
-   Expand a folder by clicking the small triangle next to its name.
-   Scroll as needed to view more directories.

### Sort Content (Optional)

-   Use the **"Sort Content"** button to organize the folders alphabetically or by other criteria, if available.

### Select a Folder

-   Click on the desired folder to highlight it.
-   Click the **"Select"** button at the bottom-right corner of the window to confirm your choice.

### Verify Your Selection

-   Once the folder is selected, the application will confirm the operation with a message (e.g., "Cache directory set successfully").

## Best Practices

1.  **Ensure Folder Permissions**:
    -   Make sure the folder has the appropriate read/write permissions for the application to access or save files.
2.  **Use a Dedicated Folder**:
    -   Create and use a specific folder (e.g., "Cache" or "App Data") to keep files organized and prevent mixing unrelated data.
3.  **Avoid System Folders**:
    -   Refrain from selecting critical system directories (e.g., `C:/Windows`) to avoid accidental changes to sensitive files.

## Common Use Cases

### Setting a Cache Directory

-   Store temporary files generated by the application to enhance performance by reusing cached data.
