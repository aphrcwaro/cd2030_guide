# Upload Data {#sec-upload-data}

This guide details how to upload data into the cd2030 app, ensuring compatibility with the Countdown Health Facility Data (HFD) Format.

## Understanding the Upload Process

The `Upload Data` module allows you to:

-   Upload health facility data structured according to the **Countdown HFD Format**.
-   Validate the uploaded file for format and data integrity.
-   Prepare the data for analysis within the app.

## Supported File Formats

The app supports the following file types:

-   **Excel Files (`.xls`, `.xlsx`):** Primarily for raw or minimally processed data.
-   **Stata Files (`.dta`):** Processed and formatted data adhering to the HFD standard.
-   **R Data Files (`.rds`):** For pre-processed data, settings, or cached data.

## Uploading Your File

Once your data is prepared:

1.  Navigate to the **Load Data** section in the app's sidebar.
2.  **Drag and Drop:** Drag your file into the designated upload area.
3.  **Browse:** Alternatively, click **Browse** to select the file from your computer.

The app will automatically validate the uploaded file.

-   **Successful Upload:** A confirmation message will appear: *"Upload successful: Your file is ready for analysis."*
-   **Upload Errors:** If errors are detected, an error message will be displayed. See the "Troubleshooting Uploads" section below.

## Troubleshooting Uploads

The following table lists common upload errors and their solutions:

| Error Message | Cause | Solution |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|
| "Unsupported file format" | File type not supported. | Save your file as `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.dta`, or `.rds`. `.dta` is the recommended format. |
| "The following required columns are missing from the data: \[column names\]" | Missing essential columns in the data. | Add the missing column(s) to your dataset and ensure their values are valid. Refer to the HFD Guidelines for required columns. |
| "The following sheets are missing: \[sheet names\]" (Primarily for Excel files) | Missing one or more required sheets in the Excel file. | Ensure all required sheets are present and conform to the template. If working with `.dta` or `.rds` files, this error should not occur. |
| "Sheet \[Sheet Name\] is empty" (Primarily for Excel files) | The sheet exists but contains no data. | Populate the sheet with valid data or remove the empty sheet. If working with `.dta` or `.rds` files, this error should not occur. |
| "Key Columns '\[column names\]' missing in \[Sheet Name\]" (Primarily for Excel files) | A key column (`district`, `year`, or `month`) is missing from the specified sheet. | Add the missing column(s) to the sheet and ensure the data is structured correctly. If working with `.dta` or `.rds` files, this error should not occur. |
| "Column name '\[column name\]' must not be duplicated. Use `.name_repair` to specify repair." | Duplicate column names in the dataset. | Ensure all column names are unique. Rename or remove duplicate columns. |
| "Non-numeric values found in numeric column '\[column name\]'. These values have been coerced to NA." | A numeric column contains non-numeric data. | Check the specified column for non-numeric values (e.g., text, special characters). Correct these values or convert them to missing values (NA) before uploading. |

## Data Validation within the App

The app performs the following validation checks during the upload process:

1.  **File Format Check:** Confirms the file is in a supported format.
2.  **Sheet Presence Check (Excel only):** Verifies that all required sheets are present.
3.  **Column Presence and Uniqueness Check:** Ensures all required columns are present and unique.
4.  **Data Availability Check:** Checks that required sheets/data are not empty and key columns are populated.
5.  **Data Type Validation:** Checks that numeric columns contain valid numeric values. Non-numeric values will be coerced to NA.

## How Errors Are Handled

-   If validation fails, the upload process stops, and an informative error message is displayed.
-   Consult the "Troubleshooting Uploads" section for solutions to common errors.
