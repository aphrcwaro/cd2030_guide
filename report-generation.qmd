## Best Practices

1. **Select the Appropriate Format**:
   - Choose a format that suits your intended use (e.g., Word for editing, PDF for sharing).

2. **Ensure Analysis is Complete**:
   - Verify that all necessary inputs and analyses are finalized before generating the report.

3. **Save the Report**:
   - Download and save the report immediately to avoid having to regenerate it later.

4. **Avoid Interruptions**:
   - Do not close the application or navigate away during the generation process.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Report Generation Fails**:
   - Ensure all required inputs for the analysis are complete.
   - Retry generating the report.

2. **Incorrect Format Selected**:
   - Regenerate the report by selecting the correct format.

3. **Report Not Downloaded**:
   - If you missed downloading, repeat the generation process.

4. **Loading Issues**:
   - If the generation process takes too long, check your internet connection or system resources.
