# Data Preparation {#sec-data-preparation}

This document outlines instructions for preparing data for the **Country Analysis of Vaccine Indicators at the District Level**. The data focuses on vaccines and will assess health service utilization at national and sub-national levels. Teams will extract and compile data from DHIS2 using a standardized template.

## General Guidelines

Follow these steps to ensure accurate and complete data preparation:

1.  **Spreadsheet Structure**: The template consists of the following worksheets:
    -   Admin_data
    -   Population_data
    -   Reporting_completeness
    -   Service_data_1
    -   Service_data_2
2.  **Data Requirements**: Extract monthly district-level data for at least **three years**.
3.  **Template Use**: Do not alter the provided template’s structure or columns unless requested.
4.  **Consistency**:
    -   Ensure district names are uniform and listed in the same order across all worksheets.
    -   Use the most recent district classification if available; otherwise, use the division covering the longest time span.
5.  **Data Extraction Methods**: Data can be extracted using either of the following methods:
    -   **Manual**: Export indicators from DHIS2 to a CSV file and compile them in the provided template.
    -   **API**: Use the GFF-provided API for automated data extraction into a CSV file, then import it into the template.

## Worksheet Instructions

Adhere to worksheet-specific instructions to ensure accurate analysis and coverage estimates.

### Admin_data

-   Enter administrative details (e.g., district names, codes).
-   This worksheet serves as the master list for districts; ensure complete consistency with other worksheets.

### Population_data

-   Populate population estimates, including demographic breakdowns specified in the template.

### Reporting_completeness

-   Record health facility reporting completeness (e.g., monthly report submission rates).

### Service_data_1 and Service_data_2

-   Include service delivery indicators such as antenatal care or immunization coverage.
-   Ensure alignment with the template’s indicator requirements.

## Data Extraction Tools

### Manual Extraction

1.  Log in to DHIS2.
2.  Export required indicators to a CSV file.
3.  Compile the data into the appropriate worksheets.

### API-Based Extraction

1.  Access the GFF API with DHIS2 credentials.
2.  Extract required indicators into a CSV file.
3.  Import the CSV data into the template.
4.  Coordinate with the Ministry of Health for API set-up if needed.
